# CEPAGRI-Data-Analysis
> ### R-based climate analysis Data-Science project 

This project was made in our sixth semester (Sept. 2021) for the Innovative Topics in Programming subject. It utilizes climate data 
collected by the Center for Meteorological and Climatic Research Applied to Agriculture ([CEPAGRI](https://www.cpa.unicamp.br/)),
located at UNICAMP, between the years of 2015-2020.<br>
- It was made utilizing the [R language](https://www.r-project.org/) and some libraries such as:
  - [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/)
  - [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/)

- The data was, and still is, collected in intervals of 10 minutes, and it scopes these stats:
  - Time of collection (date)
  - Temperature (Celsius)
  - Heat Index (Celsius)
  - Humidity (%)
  - Wind (km/h)
